# ***Tarik.GG | Admin Info***

## **Reports**

- **`Important!`** - Claim a player report by reacting with a check mark (✅) on the corresponding player report in discord. Reports are logged to the `#game-reports` channel. This lets the other admins know you are actively monitoring a reported player.

## **Banning**

**Primary Method:** Use /ban or !ban in game, must choose ban length and reason

- **`!ban <#userid|name> <minutes|0> [reason]`** - Bans a client for a specified amount of time with an optional reason. (time in minutes, 0 is a permanent ban)

**Alternate Method:** Use the website to ban a client using their SteamID or SteamID64

## **Additional Console Commands**

For example, saying `!ban bail` in chat will execute the same command as `sm_ban` and forward the output to chat. You can also use `/` instead of `!` to suppress your command from being shown to users.
